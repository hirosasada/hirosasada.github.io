### About me

- I am originally from Kumamoto, Japan. After graduating from a high school in Kumamoto, I moved to the United States to study politics and lived there for 15 years. I received my B.A. in political science at U.C. Berkeley, my M.A. in international relations at U.C. San Diego, and my Ph.D. in political science at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. Now, I am teaching at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. I also teach at Vietnam Japan University in Hanoi, Vietnam as a visiting lecturer.  
  
  My research interests include political economy, party politics, and foreign policy of Japan and East Asia. I am the author of ***The Origin of Japan’s Protectionist Agricultural Policy: Agricultural Administration in Modern Japan*** (Routledge 2023) and ***The Evolution of the Japanese Developmental State: Institutions Locked-in by Ideas*** (Routledge, 2012). The book was also published in Japanese and Korean. My articles appeared in *Asian Survey, The Japanese Political Economy, Journal of East Asian Studies, Japanese Journal of Political Science, Asian Journal of Political Science, and The SAIS Review*.
